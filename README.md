# SharkAttack-
First weekend project in Ironhack!
## 1)Intro:
For this weekend, we have been given a massive set of Data containing records of shark attacks. We had records from almost every part of the world that has a coast and  spreaded through time from even ancient greek times to now(I am starting to think that it was actually the totallity of shark attacks reported in the history of the human being).

## 2)Goal:
The main goal of the project is to set two different Hypothesis concerning sharks and based in all the data that we have. For this task we will definitely need to clean and reestructure the whole table as it is obvious that a great part of the information has been wrongly inputed or it is just non-existent.

## 3)How am I going to face it?:
For the resolution of the project I have thought of two different hypothesis:

   1) What human body part do sharks think is the most tasty?
   (or which one do they actually attack the most?).Spoiler alert: IT'S THE LEGS!
   
   2) An easy one: top 10 countries in deaths from shark attack.
   
Let's do it!
